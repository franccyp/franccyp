- 👋 Hi, I’m @franccyp
- 👀 I’m interested in cooking, music and cinematography
- 🌱 I’m currently learning business informatics (shocking, i know)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that would help me to pass my bachelor with walking colours (with flying colours would be nice but let's be realistic here)
- 📫 How to reach me : LinkedIn profile, just search me there! :)
